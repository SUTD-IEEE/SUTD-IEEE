We need a landing page for potential IEEE student branch members to find out more about the weekly activities being held.

Members can also access the internal inventory loaning system where to loan out equipment from the student branch. The new inventory loaning system has been implemented by our President, Yuxuan Li ([@xmliszt](https://github.com/xmliszt)) on Heroku.

<p>Established in 2014, IEEE SUTD Student Branch is the newest Student Branch under the IEEE Singapore Section, from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). We conduct regular internal and external workshops including PCB design, Arduino and Kivy workshops. Through LITE and Self-Initiated Projects, we offer our members the opportunity to learn additional knowledge outside the curriculum with financial sponsorship. We also provide our members with access to our internal inventory through our Loaning System.</p>
